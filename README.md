# FIND COVID-19 Tracker
Welcome to the FIND COVID-19 Tracker

This is my first ever attempt at creating an interactive dashboard in R Shiny. Let me know what you think.

All the data shown in this dashboard is taken from the FINDCov19TrackerData (https://github.com/finddx/FINDCov19TrackerData).

Please be mindful that that the Number of Days Reported measurment shows data for incomplete months/quarters, whereas the Average per 1,000 people measurements are cut off at the last complete month/quarter.

Special thanks to Seb Krantz, for his guide on how to build a Shiny App (https://github.com/SebKrantz/shiny-data-portal).
